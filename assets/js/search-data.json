You will be using the Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set donated to the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. . This dataset has already been included in your Jupyter workspace so you can easily load it. . . 2.1 Read and Split the Dataset . df = pd.read_csv(&#39;dataset_diabetes/diabetic_data.csv&#39;, header=0, na_values = &#39;?&#39;) # Preview the dataset df.head() . encounter_id patient_nbr race gender age weight admission_type_id discharge_disposition_id admission_source_id time_in_hospital ... citoglipton insulin glyburide-metformin glipizide-metformin glimepiride-pioglitazone metformin-rosiglitazone metformin-pioglitazone change diabetesMed readmitted . 0 2278392 | 8222157 | Caucasian | Female | [0-10) | NaN | 6 | 25 | 1 | 1 | ... | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | NO | . 1 149190 | 55629189 | Caucasian | Female | [10-20) | NaN | 1 | 1 | 7 | 3 | ... | No | Up | No | No | No | No | No | Ch | Yes | &gt;30 | . 2 64410 | 86047875 | AfricanAmerican | Female | [20-30) | NaN | 1 | 1 | 7 | 2 | ... | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | NO | . 3 500364 | 82442376 | Caucasian | Male | [30-40) | NaN | 1 | 1 | 7 | 2 | ... | No | Up | No | No | No | No | No | Ch | Yes | NO | . 4 16680 | 42519267 | Caucasian | Male | [40-50) | NaN | 1 | 1 | 7 | 1 | ... | No | Steady | No | No | No | No | No | Ch | Yes | NO | . 5 rows × 50 columns . . Data splits . In a production ML system, the model performance can be negatively affected by anomalies and divergence between data splits for training, evaluation, and serving. To emulate a production system, you will split the dataset into: . 70% training set | 15% evaluation set | 15% serving set | . You will then use TFDV to visualize, analyze, and understand the data. You will create a data schema from the training dataset, then compare the evaluation and serving sets with this schema to detect anomalies and data drift/skew. . . Label Column . This dataset has been prepared to analyze the factors related to readmission outcome. In this notebook, you will treat the readmitted column as the target or label column. . The target (or label) is important to know while splitting the data into training, evaluation and serving sets. In supervised learning, you need to include the target in the training and evaluation datasets. For the serving set however (i.e. the set that simulates the data coming from your users), the label column needs to be dropped since that is the feature that your model will be trying to predict. . The following function returns the training, evaluation and serving partitions of a given dataset: . def prepare_data_splits_from_dataframe(df): &#39;&#39;&#39; Splits a Pandas Dataframe into training, evaluation and serving sets. Parameters: df : pandas dataframe to split Returns: train_df: Training dataframe(70% of the entire dataset) eval_df: Evaluation dataframe (15% of the entire dataset) serving_df: Serving dataframe (15% of the entire dataset, label column dropped) &#39;&#39;&#39; # 70% of records for generating the training set train_len = int(len(df) * 0.7) # Remaining 30% of records for generating the evaluation and serving sets eval_serv_len = len(df) - train_len # Half of the 30%, which makes up 15% of total records, for generating the evaluation set eval_len = eval_serv_len // 2 # Remaining 15% of total records for generating the serving set serv_len = eval_serv_len - eval_len # Sample the train, validation and serving sets. We specify a random state for repeatable outcomes. train_df = df.iloc[:train_len].sample(frac=1, random_state=48).reset_index(drop=True) eval_df = df.iloc[train_len: train_len + eval_len].sample(frac=1, random_state=48).reset_index(drop=True) serving_df = df.iloc[train_len + eval_len: train_len + eval_len + serv_len].sample(frac=1, random_state=48).reset_index(drop=True) # Serving data emulates the data that would be submitted for predictions, so it should not have the label column. serving_df = serving_df.drop([&#39;readmitted&#39;], axis=1) return train_df, eval_df, serving_df . train_df, eval_df, serving_df = prepare_data_splits_from_dataframe(df) print(&#39;Training dataset has {} records nValidation dataset has {} records nServing dataset has {} records&#39;.format(len(train_df),len(eval_df),len(serving_df))) . Training dataset has 71236 records Validation dataset has 15265 records Serving dataset has 15265 records . . 3 - Generate and Visualize Training Data Statistics . In this section, you will be generating descriptive statistics from the dataset. This is usually the first step when dealing with a dataset you are not yet familiar with. It is also known as performing an exploratory data analysis and its purpose is to understand the data types, the data itself and any possible issues that need to be addressed. . It is important to mention that exploratory data analysis should be perfomed on the training dataset only. This is because getting information out of the evaluation or serving datasets can be seen as &quot;cheating&quot; since this data is used to emulate data that you have not collected yet and will try to predict using your ML algorithm. In general, it is a good practice to avoid leaking information from your evaluation and serving data into your model. . . Removing Irrelevant Features . Before you generate the statistics, you may want to drop irrelevant features from your dataset. You can do that with TFDV with the tfdv.StatsOptions class. It is usually not a good idea to drop features without knowing what information they contain. However there are times when this can be fairly obvious. . One of the important parameters of the StatsOptions class is feature_whitelist, which defines the features to include while calculating the data statistics. You can check the documentation to learn more about the class arguments. . In this case, you will omit the statistics for encounter_id and patient_nbr since they are part of the internal tracking of patients in the hospital and they don&#39;t contain valuable information for the task at hand. . features_to_remove = {&#39;encounter_id&#39;, &#39;patient_nbr&#39;} # Collect features to whitelist while computing the statistics approved_cols = [col for col in df.columns if (col not in features_to_remove)] # Instantiate a StatsOptions class and define the feature_whitelist property stats_options = tfdv.StatsOptions(feature_whitelist=approved_cols) # Review the features to generate the statistics print(stats_options.feature_whitelist) . [&#39;race&#39;, &#39;gender&#39;, &#39;age&#39;, &#39;weight&#39;, &#39;admission_type_id&#39;, &#39;discharge_disposition_id&#39;, &#39;admission_source_id&#39;, &#39;time_in_hospital&#39;, &#39;payer_code&#39;, &#39;medical_specialty&#39;, &#39;num_lab_procedures&#39;, &#39;num_procedures&#39;, &#39;num_medications&#39;, &#39;number_outpatient&#39;, &#39;number_emergency&#39;, &#39;number_inpatient&#39;, &#39;diag_1&#39;, &#39;diag_2&#39;, &#39;diag_3&#39;, &#39;number_diagnoses&#39;, &#39;max_glu_serum&#39;, &#39;A1Cresult&#39;, &#39;metformin&#39;, &#39;repaglinide&#39;, &#39;nateglinide&#39;, &#39;chlorpropamide&#39;, &#39;glimepiride&#39;, &#39;acetohexamide&#39;, &#39;glipizide&#39;, &#39;glyburide&#39;, &#39;tolbutamide&#39;, &#39;pioglitazone&#39;, &#39;rosiglitazone&#39;, &#39;acarbose&#39;, &#39;miglitol&#39;, &#39;troglitazone&#39;, &#39;tolazamide&#39;, &#39;examide&#39;, &#39;citoglipton&#39;, &#39;insulin&#39;, &#39;glyburide-metformin&#39;, &#39;glipizide-metformin&#39;, &#39;glimepiride-pioglitazone&#39;, &#39;metformin-rosiglitazone&#39;, &#39;metformin-pioglitazone&#39;, &#39;change&#39;, &#39;diabetesMed&#39;, &#39;readmitted&#39;] . . Exercise 1: Generate Training Statistics . TFDV allows you to generate statistics from different data formats such as CSV or a Pandas DataFrame. . Since you already have the data stored in a DataFrame you can use the function tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe() which, given a DataFrame and stats_options, generates an object of type DatasetFeatureStatisticsList. This object includes the computed statistics of the given dataset. . Complete the cell below to generate the statistics of the training set. Remember to pass the training dataframe and the stats_options that you defined above as arguments. . train_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(train_df, stats_options) ### END CODE HERE . # get the number of features used to compute statistics print(f&quot;Number of features used: {len(train_stats.datasets[0].features)}&quot;) # check the number of examples used print(f&quot;Number of examples used: {train_stats.datasets[0].num_examples}&quot;) # check the column names of the first and last feature print(f&quot;First feature: {train_stats.datasets[0].features[0].path.step[0]}&quot;) print(f&quot;Last feature: {train_stats.datasets[0].features[-1].path.step[0]}&quot;) . Number of features used: 48 Number of examples used: 71236 First feature: race Last feature: readmitted . Expected Output: . Number of features used: 48 Number of examples used: 71236 First feature: race Last feature: readmitted . . Exercise 2: Visualize Training Statistics . Now that you have the computed statistics in the DatasetFeatureStatisticsList instance, you will need a way to visualize these to get actual insights. TFDV provides this functionality through the method tfdv.visualize_statistics(). . Using this function in an interactive Python environment such as this one will output a very nice and convenient way to interact with the descriptive statistics you generated earlier. . Try it out yourself! Remember to pass in the generated training statistics in the previous exercise as an argument. . tfdv.visualize_statistics(train_stats) ### END CODE HERE . . 4 - Infer a data schema . A schema defines the properties of the data and can thus be used to detect errors. Some of these properties include: . which features are expected to be present | feature type | the number of values for a feature in each example | the presence of each feature across all examples | the expected domains of features | . The schema is expected to be fairly static, whereas statistics can vary per data split. So, you will infer the data schema from only the training dataset. Later, you will generate statistics for evaluation and serving datasets and compare their state with the data schema to detect anomalies, drift and skew. . . Exercise 3: Infer the training set schema . Schema inference is straightforward using tfdv.infer_schema(). This function needs only the statistics (an instance of DatasetFeatureStatisticsList) of your data as input. The output will be a Schema protocol buffer containing the results. . A complimentary function is tfdv.display_schema() for displaying the schema in a table. This accepts a Schema protocol buffer as input. . Fill the code below to infer the schema from the training statistics using TFDV and display the result. . # Infer the data schema by using the training statistics that you generated schema = tfdv.infer_schema(statistics=train_stats) # Display the data schema tfdv.display_schema(schema) ### END CODE HERE .

Number of features in schema: 48 Second feature in schema: gender . Expected Output: . Number of features in schema: 48 Second feature in schema: gender . Be sure to check the information displayed before moving forward. . . 5 - Calculate, Visualize and Fix Evaluation Anomalies . It is important that the schema of the evaluation data is consistent with the training data since the data that your model is going to receive should be consistent to the one you used to train it with. . Moreover, it is also important that the features of the evaluation data belong roughly to the same range as the training data. This ensures that the model will be evaluated on a similar loss surface covered during training. . . Exercise 4: Compare Training and Evaluation Statistics . Now you are going to generate the evaluation statistics and compare it with training statistics. You can use the tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe() function for this. But this time, you&#39;ll need to pass the evaluation data. For the stats_options parameter, the list you used before works here too. . Remember that to visualize the evaluation statistics you can use tfdv.visualize_statistics(). . However, it is impractical to visualize both statistics separately and do your comparison from there. Fortunately, TFDV has got this covered. You can use the visualize_statistics function and pass additional parameters to overlay the statistics from both datasets (referenced as left-hand side and right-hand side statistics). Let&#39;s see what these parameters are: . lhs_statistics: Required parameter.

For this case, remember to define the lhs_statistics protocol with the eval_stats, and the optional rhs_statistics protocol with the train_stats. . Additionally, check the function for the protocol name declaration, and define the lhs and rhs names as &#39;EVAL_DATASET&#39; and &#39;TRAIN_DATASET&#39; respectively. . # Generate evaluation dataset statistics # HINT: Remember to use the evaluation dataframe and to pass the stats_options (that you defined before) as an argument eval_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(eval_df, stats_options) # Compare evaluation data with training data # HINT: Remember to use both the evaluation and training statistics with the lhs_statistics and rhs_statistics arguments # HINT: Assign the names of &#39;EVAL_DATASET&#39; and &#39;TRAIN_DATASET&#39; to the lhs and rhs protocols tfdv.visualize_statistics( lhs_statistics=eval_stats, rhs_statistics=train_stats, lhs_name=&#39;EVAL_DATASET&#39;, rhs_name=&#39;TRAIN_DATASET&#39; ) ### END CODE HERE . # get the number of features used to compute statistics print(f&quot;Number of features: {len(eval_stats.datasets[0].features)}&quot;) # check the number of examples used print(f&quot;Number of examples: {eval_stats.datasets[0].num_examples}&quot;) # check the column names of the first and last feature print(f&quot;First feature: {eval_stats.datasets[0].features[0].path.step[0]}&quot;) print(f&quot;Last feature: {eval_stats.datasets[0].features[-1].path.step[0]}&quot;) . Number of features: 48 Number of examples: 15265 First feature: race Last feature: readmitted . Expected Output: . Number of features: 48 Number of examples: 15265 First feature: race Last feature: readmitted . . Exercise 5: Detecting Anomalies . At this point, you should ask if your evaluation dataset matches the schema from your training dataset. For instance, if you scroll through the output cell in the previous exercise, you can see that the categorical feature glimepiride-pioglitazone has 1 unique value in the training set while the evaluation dataset has 2. You can verify with the built-in Pandas describe() method as well. . train_df[&quot;glimepiride-pioglitazone&quot;].describe() . count 71236 unique 1 top No freq 71236 Name: glimepiride-pioglitazone, dtype: object . eval_df[&quot;glimepiride-pioglitazone&quot;].describe() . count 15265 unique 2 top No freq 15264 Name: glimepiride-pioglitazone, dtype: object . It is possible but highly inefficient to visually inspect and determine all the anomalies. So, let&#39;s instead use TFDV functions to detect and display these. . You can use the function tfdv.validate_statistics() for detecting anomalies and tfdv.display_anomalies() for displaying them. . The validate_statistics() method has two required arguments: . an instance of DatasetFeatureStatisticsList | an instance of Schema | . Fill in the following graded function which, given the statistics and schema, displays the anomalies found. . def calculate_and_display_anomalies(statistics, schema): &#39;&#39;&#39; Calculate and display anomalies. Parameters: statistics : Data statistics in statistics_pb2.DatasetFeatureStatisticsList format schema : Data schema in schema_pb2.Schema format Returns: display of calculated anomalies &#39;&#39;&#39; ### START CODE HERE # HINTS: Pass the statistics and schema parameters into the validation function anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(statistics=statistics, schema=schema) # HINTS: Display input anomalies by using the calculated anomalies tfdv.display_anomalies(anomalies) ### END CODE HERE . You should see detected anomalies in the medical_specialty and glimepiride-pioglitazone features by running the cell below. . calculate_and_display_anomalies(eval_stats, schema=schema) . No anomalies found. . . Exercise 6: Fix evaluation anomalies in the schema . The evaluation data has records with values for the features glimepiride-pioglitazone and medical_speciality that were not included in the schema generated from the training data. You can fix this by adding the new values that exist in the evaluation dataset to the domain of these features. . To get the domain of a particular feature you can use tfdv.get_domain(). . You can use the append() method to the value property of the returned domain to add strings to the valid list of values. To be more explicit, given a domain you can do something like: . domain.value.append(&quot;feature_value&quot;) . # Get the domain associated with the input feature, glimepiride-pioglitazone, from the schema glimepiride_pioglitazone_domain = tfdv.get_domain(schema, &#39;glimepiride-pioglitazone&#39;) print(glimepiride_pioglitazone_domain) # HINT: Append the missing value &#39;Steady&#39; to the domain glimepiride_pioglitazone_domain.value.append(&#39;Steady&#39;) print(glimepiride_pioglitazone_domain) # Get the domain associated with the input feature, medical_specialty, from the schema medical_specialty_domain = tfdv.get_domain(schema, &#39;medical_specialty&#39;) print(type(medical_specialty_domain)) # HINT: Append the missing value &#39;Neurophysiology&#39; to the domain medical_specialty_domain.value.append(&#39;Neurophysiology&#39;) #print(medical_specialty_domain) # HINT: Re-calculate and re-display anomalies with the new schema calculate_and_display_anomalies(eval_stats, schema=schema) ### END CODE HERE . name: &#34;glimepiride-pioglitazone&#34; value: &#34;No&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; name: &#34;glimepiride-pioglitazone&#34; value: &#34;No&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; value: &#34;Steady&#34; &lt;class &#39;tensorflow_metadata.proto.v0.schema_pb2.StringDomain&#39;&gt; . No anomalies found. . If you did the exercise correctly, you should see &quot;No anomalies found.&quot; after running the cell above. . . 6 - Schema Environments . By default, all datasets in a pipeline should use the same schema. However, there are some exceptions. . For example, the label column is dropped in the serving set so this will be flagged when comparing with the training set schema. . In this case, introducing slight schema variations is necessary. . . Exercise 7: Check anomalies in the serving set . Now you are going to check for anomalies in the serving data. The process is very similar to the one you previously did for the evaluation data with a little change. . Let&#39;s create a new StatsOptions that is aware of the information provided by the schema and use it when generating statistics from the serving DataFrame. . options = tfdv.StatsOptions(schema=schema, infer_type_from_schema=True, feature_whitelist=approved_cols) . # Generate serving dataset statistics # HINT: Remember to use the serving dataframe and to pass the newly defined statistics options #serving_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(None, stats_options=None) serving_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(serving_df, stats_options=options) # HINT: Calculate and display anomalies using the generated serving statistics #calculate_and_display_anomalies(None, schema=None) calculate_and_display_anomalies(serving_stats, schema=schema) ### END CODE HERE . Anomaly short description Anomaly long description . Feature name . &#39;metformin-pioglitazone&#39; Unexpected string values | Examples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%). | . &#39;payer_code&#39; Unexpected string values | Examples contain values missing from the schema: FR (&lt;1%). | . &#39;medical_specialty&#39; Unexpected string values | Examples contain values missing from the schema: DCPTEAM (&lt;1%), Endocrinology-Metabolism (&lt;1%), Resident (&lt;1%). | . &#39;metformin-rosiglitazone&#39; Unexpected string values | Examples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%). | . &#39;readmitted&#39; Column dropped | Column is completely missing | . You should see that metformin-rosiglitazone, metformin-pioglitazone, payer_code and medical_specialty features have an anomaly (i.e. Unexpected string values) which is less than 1%. . Let&#39;s relax the anomaly detection constraints for the last two of these features by defining the min_domain_mass of the feature&#39;s distribution constraints. . # Get the feature and relax to match 90% of the domain payer_code = tfdv.get_feature(schema, &#39;payer_code&#39;) payer_code.distribution_constraints.min_domain_mass = 0.9 # Get the feature and relax to match 90% of the domain medical_specialty = tfdv.get_feature(schema, &#39;medical_specialty&#39;) medical_specialty.distribution_constraints.min_domain_mass = 0.9 # Detect anomalies with the updated constraints calculate_and_display_anomalies(serving_stats, schema=schema) . Anomaly short description Anomaly long description . Feature name . &#39;metformin-pioglitazone&#39; Unexpected string values | Examples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%). | . &#39;metformin-rosiglitazone&#39; Unexpected string values | Examples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%). | . &#39;readmitted&#39; Column dropped | Column is completely missing | . If the payer_code and medical_specialty are no longer part of the output cell, then the relaxation worked! . . Exercise 8: Modifying the Domain . Let&#39;s investigate the possible cause of the anomalies for the other features, namely metformin-pioglitazone and metformin-rosiglitazone. From the output of the previous exercise, you&#39;ll see that the anomaly long description says: &quot;Examples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%)&quot;. You can redisplay the schema and look at the domain of these features to verify this statement. . When you inferred the schema at the start of this lab, it&#39;s possible that some values were not detected in the training data so it was not included in the expected domain values of the feature&#39;s schema. In the case of metformin-rosiglitazone and metformin-pioglitazone, the value &quot;Steady&quot; is indeed missing. You will just see &quot;No&quot; in the domain of these two features after running the code cell below. . tfdv.display_schema(schema) . Type Presence Valency Domain .

Towards the bottom of the Domain-Values pairs of the cell above, you can see that many features (including &#39;metformin&#39;) have the same values: [&#39;Down&#39;, &#39;No&#39;, &#39;Steady&#39;, &#39;Up&#39;]. These values are common to many features including the ones with missing values during schema inference. . TFDV allows you to modify the domains of some features to match an existing domain. To address the detected anomaly, you can set the domain of these features to the domain of the metformin feature. . Complete the function below to set the domain of a feature list to an existing feature domain. . For this, use the tfdv.set_domain() function, which has the following parameters: . schema: The schema | . feature_path: The name of the feature whose domain needs to be set. | . domain: A domain protocol buffer or the name of a global string domain present in the input schema. | . def modify_domain_of_features(features_list, schema, to_domain_name): &#39;&#39;&#39; Modify a list of features&#39; domains.

Let&#39;s do a final check of anomalies to see if this solved the issue. . calculate_and_display_anomalies(serving_stats, schema=schema) . Anomaly short description Anomaly long description . Feature name . &#39;readmitted&#39; Column dropped | Column is completely missing | . You should now see the metformin-pioglitazone and metformin-rosiglitazone features dropped from the output anomalies. . . Exercise 9: Detecting anomalies with environments . There is still one thing to address. The readmitted feature (which is the label column) showed up as an anomaly (&#39;Column dropped&#39;). Since labels are not expected in the serving data, let&#39;s tell TFDV to ignore this detected anomaly. . This requirement of introducing slight schema variations can be expressed by using environments. In particular, features in the schema can be associated with a set of environments using default_environment, in_environment and not_in_environment. . schema.default_environment.append(&#39;TRAINING&#39;) schema.default_environment.append(&#39;SERVING&#39;) tfdv.display_schema(schema) .

| . &#39;readmitted&#39; &#39;&lt;30&#39;, &#39;&gt;30&#39;, &#39;NO&#39; | . Complete the code below to exclude the readmitted feature from the SERVING environment. . To achieve this, you can use the tfdv.get_feature() function to get the readmitted feature from the inferred schema and use its not_in_environment attribute to specify that readmitted should be removed from the SERVING environment&#39;s schema. This attribute is a list so you will have to append the name of the environment that you wish to omit this feature for. . To be more explicit, given a feature you can do something like: . feature.not_in_environment.append(&#39;NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT&#39;) . The function tfdv.get_feature receives the following parameters: . schema: The schema. | feature_path: The path of the feature to obtain from the schema. In this case this is equal to the name of the feature. | . # Specify that &#39;readmitted&#39; feature is not in SERVING environment. # HINT: Append the &#39;SERVING&#39; environmnet to the not_in_environment attribute of the feature #tfdv.get_feature(schema, None).not_in_environment.append(None) not_in_environment_feature = tfdv.get_feature(schema,&#39;readmitted&#39;).not_in_environment.append(&#39;SERVING&#39;) # HINT: Calculate anomalies with the validate_statistics function by using the serving statistics, # inferred schema and the SERVING environment parameter. #serving_anomalies_with_env = tfdv.validate_statistics(None, schema, environment=None) serving_anomalies_with_env = tfdv.validate_statistics(serving_stats, schema, environment=not_in_environment_feature) ### END CODE HERE . You should see &quot;No anomalies found&quot; by running the cell below. . tfdv.display_anomalies(serving_anomalies_with_env) . Anomaly short description Anomaly long description . Feature name . &#39;readmitted&#39; Column dropped | Column is completely missing | . Now you have succesfully addressed all anomaly-related issues! . . 7 - Check for Data Drift and Skew . During data validation, you also need to check for data drift and data skew between the training and serving data. You can do this by specifying the skew_comparator and drift_comparator in the schema. . Drift and skew is expressed in terms of L-infinity distance which evaluates the difference between vectors as the greatest of the differences along any coordinate dimension. . You can set the threshold distance so that you receive warnings when the drift is higher than is acceptable. Setting the correct distance is typically an iterative process requiring domain knowledge and experimentation. . Let&#39;s check for the skew in the diabetesMed feature and drift in the payer_code feature. . diabetes_med = tfdv.get_feature(schema, &#39;diabetesMed&#39;) diabetes_med.skew_comparator.infinity_norm.threshold = 0.035 # domain knowledge helps to determine this threshold # Calculate drift for the payer_code feature payer_code = tfdv.get_feature(schema, &#39;payer_code&#39;) payer_code.drift_comparator.infinity_norm.threshold = 0.035 # domain knowledge helps to determine this threshold # Calculate anomalies skew_drift_anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(train_stats, schema, previous_statistics=eval_stats, serving_statistics=serving_stats) # Display anomalies tfdv.display_anomalies(skew_drift_anomalies) . No anomalies found. . In both of these cases, the detected anomaly distance is not too far from the threshold value of 0.03. For this exercise, let&#39;s accept this as within bounds (i.e. you can set the distance to something like 0.035 instead). . However, if the anomaly truly indicates a skew and drift, then further investigation is necessary as this could have a direct impact on model performance. . . 8 - Display Stats for Data Slices . Finally, you can slice the dataset and calculate the statistics for each unique value of a feature. By default, TFDV computes statistics for the overall dataset in addition to the configured slices. Each slice is identified by a unique name which is set as the dataset name in the DatasetFeatureStatistics protocol buffer. Generating and displaying statistics over different slices of data can help track model and anomaly metrics. . Let&#39;s first define a few helper functions to make our code in the exercise more neat. . def split_datasets(dataset_list): &#39;&#39;&#39; split datasets. Parameters: dataset_list: List of datasets to split Returns: datasets: sliced data &#39;&#39;&#39; datasets = [] for dataset in dataset_list.datasets: proto_list = DatasetFeatureStatisticsList() proto_list.datasets.extend([dataset]) datasets.append(proto_list) return datasets def display_stats_at_index(index, datasets): &#39;&#39;&#39; display statistics at the specified data index Parameters: index : index to show the anomalies datasets: split data Returns: display of generated sliced data statistics at the specified index &#39;&#39;&#39; if index &lt; len(datasets): print(datasets[index].datasets[0].name) tfdv.visualize_statistics(datasets[index]) . The function below returns a list of DatasetFeatureStatisticsList protocol buffers. As shown in the ungraded lab, the first one will be for All Examples followed by individual slices through the feature you specified. . To configure TFDV to generate statistics for dataset slices, you will use the function tfdv.StatsOptions() with the following 4 arguments: . schema | . slice_functions passed as a list. | . infer_type_from_schema set to True. | . feature_whitelist set to the approved features. | . Remember that slice_functions only work with generate_statistics_from_csv() so you will need to convert the dataframe to CSV. . def sliced_stats_for_slice_fn(slice_fn, approved_cols, dataframe, schema): &#39;&#39;&#39; generate statistics for the sliced data. Parameters: slice_fn : slicing definition approved_cols: list of features to pass to the statistics options dataframe: pandas dataframe to slice schema: the schema Returns: slice_info_datasets: statistics for the sliced dataset &#39;&#39;&#39; # Set the StatsOptions slice_stats_options = tfdv.StatsOptions(schema=schema, slice_functions=[slice_fn], infer_type_from_schema=True, feature_whitelist=approved_cols) # Convert Dataframe to CSV since `slice_functions` works only with `tfdv.generate_statistics_from_csv` CSV_PATH = &#39;slice_sample.csv&#39; dataframe.to_csv(CSV_PATH) # Calculate statistics for the sliced dataset sliced_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_csv(CSV_PATH, stats_options=slice_stats_options) # Split the dataset using the previously defined split_datasets function slice_info_datasets = split_datasets(sliced_stats) return slice_info_datasets . With that, you can now use the helper functions to generate and visualize statistics for the sliced datasets. . slice_fn = slicing_util.get_feature_value_slicer(features={&#39;medical_specialty&#39;: None}) # Generate stats for the sliced dataset slice_datasets = sliced_stats_for_slice_fn(slice_fn, approved_cols, dataframe=train_df, schema=schema) # Print name of slices for reference print(f&#39;Statistics generated for: n&#39;) print(&#39; n&#39;.join([sliced.datasets[0].name for sliced in slice_datasets])) # Display at index 10, which corresponds to the slice named `medical_specialty_Gastroenterology` display_stats_at_index(1, slice_datasets) .

If you are curious, try different slice indices to extract the group statistics. For instance, index=5 corresponds to all medical_specialty_Surgery-General records. You can also try slicing through multiple features as shown in the ungraded lab. . Another challenge is to implement your own helper functions. For instance, you can make a display_stats_for_slice_name() function so you don&#39;t have to determine the index of a slice. If done correctly, you can just do display_stats_for_slice_name(&#39;medical_specialty_Gastroenterology&#39;, slice_datasets) and it will generate the same result as display_stats_at_index(10, slice_datasets). . . 9 - Freeze the schema . Now that the schema has been reviewed, you will store the schema in a file in its &quot;frozen&quot; state. This can be used to validate incoming data once your application goes live to your users. . This is pretty straightforward using Tensorflow&#39;s io utils and TFDV&#39;s write_schema_text() function. . OUTPUT_DIR = &quot;output&quot; file_io.recursive_create_dir(OUTPUT_DIR) # Use TensorFlow text output format pbtxt to store the schema schema_file = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, &#39;schema.pbtxt&#39;) # write_schema_text function expect the defined schema and output path as parameters tfdv.write_schema_text(schema, schema_file) . After submitting this assignment, you can click the Jupyter logo in the left upper corner of the screen to check the Jupyter filesystem. The schema.pbtxt file should be inside the output directory. . Congratulations on finishing this week&#39;s assignment! A lot of concepts where introduced and now you should feel more familiar with using TFDV for inferring schemas, anomaly detection and other data-related tasks. . Keep it up! .",
