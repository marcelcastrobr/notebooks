        "Developing machine learning models is usually an iterative process. You start with an initial design then reconfigure until you get a model that can be trained efficiently in terms of time and compute resources. As you may already know, these settings that you adjust are called _hyperparameters_. These are the variables that govern the training process and the topology of an ML model. These remain constant over the training process and directly impact the performance of your ML program. \n",
